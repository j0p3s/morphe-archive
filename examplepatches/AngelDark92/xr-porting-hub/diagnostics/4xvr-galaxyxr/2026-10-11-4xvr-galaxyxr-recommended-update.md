# 4XVR Galaxy XR set — recommended by default + first on-device feedback fix (2026-10-11)

Appends to [the implementation record](2026-10-11-4xvr-galaxyxr-implementation.md); its
`default-off` conclusion is superseded here.

## Owner decision

All 13 non-experimental 4XVR patches (G1 launch, G7 controller models, G8 refresh profile, G3 HDR +
payload, G4 audio + payload, G5 render dispatch + payload, G6 subtitle suite + payload, G9 continuity
helper, and the `Galaxy XR set (4XVR 2.0.22/20022)`) are now `default = true` (recommended). The
experimental `Meta platform decoupling (4XVR, experimental)` stays `default = false` — its own label
says to verify on device before enabling. Guidance updated to match: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`,
`TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md`, `PATCH_CATALOG.md`, `DEBUGGING.md`, and the in-repo morphe-patches skill.
`FourXvrBundleTest` now asserts the recommended flags (set, 8 members, 4 payloads on; decoupling off).

## First on-device feedback and root cause (manager on SM-S928B, 2026-10-11)

- Manager 1.35.0 / Patcher 1.15.1 / source 1.28.0-dev.7; app 4XVR 2.0.22/20022; 14 patches selected.
- Failure: `Frame-synced render dispatch (4XVR)` →
  `IllegalStateException: Expected one V4Render->RenderFrame call behind the p1 branch in Main4XActivity.RenderFrame; found 0`.
- Root cause (ours, in `FourXvrDexKit.pRegister`): the parameter offset counted parameter **types**
  instead of parameter **words**. `RenderFrame(ZJJ)V` has 5 parameter words (`Z` + `J` + `J`), so the
  boolean parameter `p1` sits 5 registers below the register count, not 3. Every wide-parameter
  method was mis-anchored; the drain check could never match. Confirmed against the decoded stock
  tree (`4xvr-orig/smali/cn/vr4p/oculus4xvrplayerov/Main4XActivity.smali:6637-6642`):
  `:cond_0` / `if-eqz p1, :cond_1` / `iget-object v5 … m_V4Render` /
  `invoke-virtual {v5, v1, v2, v3, v4}, Lcn/vr4p/oculus4xvrplayerov/V4Render;->RenderFrame(JJ)V`.
- Fix: `parameterWordCount` (J/D = 2 words) feeds `pRegister`; the drain anchor now requires the
  single `V4Render->RenderFrame` call and validates the `IF_EQZ p1` branch, reporting the actual
  opcode/register on mismatch. Regression test: `FourXvrDexKitTest` (portable, no APK).
- Still pending: re-run on the phone against a build that contains the fix (needs a new release).

## Second on-device run (source 1.28.0-dev.8) and follow-up fix

- Same setup; `Galaxy XR set` failed inside its dependency `libplacebo HDR pipeline (4XVR)`:
  `IllegalStateException: Expected one access$1500 surface reload before MediaCodec.configure in run(); found 2`.
- Root cause (ours): the discriminator accepted any `access$1500` load with a `configure` within
  6 instructions. `MyVideoRunnable.run()` has four `access$1500` loads and two of them sit near a
  `MediaCodec.configure` (decoded stock indices 582→586 and 959→962). The reference build swaps only
  the first — the one with the `[move-result-object v2, const/4 v9, const/4 v10]` tail. The decoded
  tree matches the phone's dex at both sites; dev.8 had already passed every earlier anchor
  (Main4XActivity.RenderFrame drain, the color-transfer insert), so the anchor logic, not the base,
  was wrong.
- Fix: the anchor now requires the exact tail `[move-result-object v2, const/4 v9 0, const/4 v10 0,
  configure on MediaCodec]` — exactly one site matches. The replacement stays `move-object v2, v10`
  (routed surface parked by the color-transfer block) plus two nops, matching the reference swap's
  semantics. Local gate re-run (`:patches:test :patches:buildAndroid :patches:generatePatchesList`):
  BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- Still pending: phone retest on a build containing this fix. The G3 anchors after this point
  (SetDataSource transition, seekPosForce, ActResume) have not executed on device yet.

## Morphe app-tile icon (same day, after dev.8)

- Feedback: on the phone the Morphe Manager's 4XVR tile is blank while Steam Link shows its icon.
- Mechanism found in the Manager source (`AppDataResolver.kt`): the tile icon loader resolves the
  stored APK's manifest icon via `packageManager.getResourcesForApplication(appInfo)` +
  `ResourcesCompat.getDrawable(resources, appInfo.icon, null)`. Steam Link's icon is the canonical
  `ic_launcher` shape; stock 4XVR only ships the custom `@mipmap/ic_4xplayer_launch` with its
  adaptive XML in a nonstandard `mipmap-anydpi` directory.
- Fix: new G11 patch `Galaxy XR launcher icon (4XVR)` (recommended, in the set): re-exposes the
  stock artwork from the decoded base under canonical names — `res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml`
  and `ic_launcher_round.xml` (referencing the existing `ic_4xplayer_launch_background/foreground`
  layers) plus the stock density PNGs as `ic_launcher*.png` — and repoints the manifest
  `android:icon` / `android:roundIcon` at them. Bundle payloads under `fourxvr/icon/` (12 files,
  hashes pinned in `FourXvrPayloadResourceTest`); the set now has 9 members and the catalogs 15
  4XVR entries.
- Verified: local gate green; tests 158 executed + 12 skipped / 0 failures. Pending: phone check on
  a release carrying this patch. Caveat: the tile for the *imported original* APK (before patching)
  cannot be changed by any patch — a blank tile there would be Manager-side behavior.

## Verification (local, 2026-10-11, after the fix)

- `:patches:test :patches:buildAndroid :patches:generatePatchesList -PreleaseChannel=experimental`:
  BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Test results on disk: 170 tests — 158 executed + 12 skipped (0 failures,
  0 errors). The 12 skipped are the SteamLink real decoded-input audits with explicit
  `assumeTrue("… BLOCKED: missing exact …")` gates (no 5001812 decoded tree and similar absent
  local fixtures — the designed fresh-checkout behavior; no synthetic replacement). The 4XVR
  suites are 8/8 executed with 0 skips: payload hashes, native guards, manifest fixture,
  parameter-word regression, recommended-flags gate.
- `patches-list*.json` regenerated: the 13 4XVR entries are `default: true`, the experimental
  decoupling `default: false`.
- Evidence labels: static + local Gradle only. The phone run above was against the previous
  release (before this fix); the headset has not run this build.

## Update 2026-10-12 (owner decision): the set wrapper is deleted

- `fourxvr/RecommendedBundles.kt` and the `Galaxy XR set (4XVR 2.0.22/20022)` wrapper are removed,
  mirroring the Steam Link wrapper deletion. 4XVR now exposes 14 patches with 13 individual
  defaults (9 members + 4 payloads); `Meta platform decoupling (4XVR, experimental)` stays off.
- The shared `RECOMMENDED_SETS` constant and the generator's `CATEGORY_ORDER` entry are gone; no
  catalog or `TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md` renders a `Recommended sets` group. `FourXvrBundleTest`
  keeps the member and payload default checks; `test_generate_patches_readme.py` fixtures move to
  the remaining categories.
- Regenerated: `patches-list*.json` (42 entries, 30 default-true; stable 34) and
  `TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md` via the repository script.
- Local verification: `:patches:test :patches:buildAndroid :patches:generatePatchesList
  -PreleaseChannel=experimental` BUILD SUCCESSFUL; 169 tests, 156 executed + 13 skipped, 0
  failures/errors; `test_generate_patches_readme.py` 4/4. Headset runtime acceptance remains
  pending; no runtime claim in this record.
