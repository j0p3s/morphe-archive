## ⚠️ Version support

### Yanosik

The patches currently target **26.9.0 (arm64-v8a, version code 6001512)**
only, because the obfuscated class names they reference (`r5f`, `l9f`, `tmd`, `m8b`, …) change between
releases. When updating to a new version, re-check the fingerprints in:

- `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/polishapps/patches/yanosik/ads/RemoveAdsPatch.kt`
- `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/polishapps/patches/yanosik/premium/UnlockProPatch.kt`
- `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/polishapps/patches/yanosik/radio/RemoveRadioPatch.kt`

> The radio patch is the most version-robust: it flips the availability flag
> `DashboardRadioConfiguration.a()`, whose class/method names are not obfuscated.

## 🚀 Releases & CI

Everything is automated from the **`main`** branch:

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:` → minor, `fix:` / `perf:` → patch, `chore:` / `docs:` → no release.
- A `feat`/`fix` push to `main` runs [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml),
  which builds the `.mpp`, updates `patches-list.json`, `patches-bundle.json`, `CHANGELOG.md` and the
  patches list in this README, then publishes a GitHub release with the `.mpp` attached.
- Commits that don't trigger a release just verify the project compiles.
- Pull requests and non-`main` branches run [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml)
  to verify the patches build.

The Gradle build resolves the `app.morphe.patches` plugin from the Morphe registry, so CI passes
`GITHUB_TOKEN` (with `packages: read`) automatically.

## 🛠️ Building locally

- Run `./gradlew buildAndroid`
- The built patches `.mpp` file is found in `patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp`
- Patch an app with [Morphe Desktop](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-desktop) or the Morphe CLI:

```
java -jar cli.jar patch --patches patches-*.mpp Yanosik_26.9.0.apkm
```

> Building requires a GitHub personal access token with `read:packages` for the Morphe registry
> (`gpr.user` / `gpr.key` Gradle properties or `GITHUB_ACTOR` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variables).
> See the [Morphe documentation](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-documentation).

## ➕ Adding another app

1. Add a `Compatibility` constant for the app in
   `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/polishapps/patches/shared/Constants.kt`.
2. Create a package `patches/src/main/kotlin/app/polishapps/patches/<app>/`.
3. Add the patch(es) there using the shared helpers in `.../shared/Utils.kt`.
